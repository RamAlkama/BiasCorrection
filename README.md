# BiasCorrection
In the context of climate and environmental data, bias correction can be used to adjust for errors in historical weather records and to remove inconsistencies between models and observations.

Python is a popular programming language that can be used to perform bias correction. Here are some steps that can be followed to perform bias correction in Python:

    Import required libraries 
    Load the observational data and model data.
    Calculate the bias between the two datasets.
    Subtract the mean bias from the model data.
